# express-cms
A CMS build with express JS

This is a very ambitious project, but here goes.

This is me trying to replicate what Drupal does but without the 'generic-ness' that drupal offers.

At first this might sound crazy, but I think Drupal's 'generic-ness' makes it a very complicated and difficult to learn/use.

So I thought I'd try to make my own CMS to see how the whole thing would work.

For now, this is how I intend to structure it.

- You create pages.
  - Pages have 'bands'
    - Bands have content e.g. text, images etc.
    
Once this is done, I'd look into making a more generic 'object' like a node, so users can start to define their own content types. But hopefully, this generic-ness will make more sense than what Drupal has to offer.
