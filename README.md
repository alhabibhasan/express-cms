# express-cms
A CMS build with express JS

This is a very ambitious project, but here goes.

This is me trying to replicate what Drupal does but without the 'generic-ness' that drupal offers.

At first this might sound crazy, but I think Drupal's 'generic-ness' makes it a very complicated and difficult to learn/use.

So I thought I'd try to make my own CMS to see how the whole thing would work.
